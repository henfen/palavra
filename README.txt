Hi Everyone, inside the documentation Folder you can see the PDF for the design asked. (And a tiny website with the how to use software)
This is the Root for the software, it will expect all the dictionaries to be under the filteredDics folder here.
All the java files are inside the src folder (following the path).

Thank you,
Henrique Rodrigues
