            <h2>What is Palavra?</h2>
            <h3>An anagram/Pangram/Palidrome checker and generator</h3>
            <p>The idea behind palavra was only an College Assignment, that required a String inverser, splitter, palindrome and panagram checker.</p>
            <p>But I want to do more, so I made a Graphic User Interface, and inputed some new functions, with plenty more to come, if I don't retire from this project.</p>
            <h3>The Name</h3>
            <p>Palavra means Word in portuguese, and besides that the anagrams for palavra give some very funny words in Portuguese and Italian, so the Slogan is: a software that Parlava (past tense of speak in Italian) a Palavar(A series of words that don't make much sense) of Palrava(words without much meaning). Last both are in Portuguese</p>

                    <p class="subLi">The Output:</p>
                    <p class="subLi">The first line will tell if the input was a Pangram, if it wasn't this line will be omited</p>
                    <p class="subLi">From now on, the output will show each word, and if it was a Palindrome, in this case, only a is detected as a Palindrome, for all words that have its position in the phrase as a multiple of the inputed number, the output will reverse it. if the input has more than 1 number, just the last one will be considered.</p>
                    <p class="subLi">if the number was greater than the amount of words in the phrase the last line of the output will tell you. The output will ignore anything that is not a letter, a number or a -</p>
                </li>   
                <li>12. This will use the dictionaries selected to generate the inputed number (between 1 and 9) of words, if no input is given it will generate 3 words.</li>
